Human: Okay now give me a situation where the airplane is on station searching. The search system operator gets a possible detection on an item been sought and requests a achange in flight pattern

----
Step6: radio --> {"speaker": "Ground station operator", "listener": "Maritime authorities", "content": "Possible detection reported by SAR aircraft, and the flight pattern has been changed to investigate further."}
----
Step7: radio --> {"speaker": "Ground station operator", "listener": "Copilot", "content": "Acknowledged. Please keep us updated with any further developments."}
----
Step8: radio --> {"speaker": "Copilot", "listener": "Search operator", "content": "Ground station acknowledged the change in flight pattern. Keep us updated with any further developments."}

Step9: operate_systems --> {"operator": "ground station operator", "action": "monitor", "system": "SAR operations", "value": "ongoing"}
----
Step10: operate_systems --> {"operator": "ground station operator", "action": "report", "system": "environmental information", "value": "current weather conditions remain stable; no significant changes expected"}

Step14: radio --> {"speaker": "Ground station operator", "listener": "Copilot", "content": "Monitoring ongoing SAR operations. Awaiting further updates."}
----
Step15: radio --> {"speaker": "Copilot", "listener": "Ground station operator", "content": "Acknowledged. We will provide updates as we receive more information."}
----
Step16: operate_systems --> {"operator": "copilot", "action": "report", "system": "navigation", "value": "adjusting to investigate detection"}
----
Step17: radio --> {"speaker": "Copilot", "listener": "Search operator", "content": "Please provide any additional details on the possible detection as we adjust our navigation."}
----
Step18: operate_systems --> {"operator": "search operator", "action": "report", "system": "search radar", "value": "possible object detected 2 nautical miles NE"}
----
Step19: radio --> {"speaker": "Search operator", "listener": "Copilot", "content": "Possible object detected 2 nautical miles NE. Adjusting radar for a closer look."}
----
Step20: radio --> {"speaker": "Copilot", "listener": "Pilot", "content": "Possible object detected 2 nautical miles NE. Adjust navigation accordingly."}
----
Step21: operate_systems --> {"operator": "pilot", "action": "operate", "system": "navigation", "value": "adjust to 2 nautical miles NE"}
----
Step22: radio --> {"speaker": "Copilot", "listener": "Ground station operator", "content": "Adjusting navigation to 2 nautical miles NE to investigate possible object detection."}
